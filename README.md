# Shape Recognition Project

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to the shape recognition tasks from the Pattern Recognition course at the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering. The tasks involve designing innovative systems for recognizing shapes based on hypothesis testing and classification algorithms.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Shape Recognition
- **Dataset**: Pressure values from writing letters on a graphical tablet.
- **Objective**: Implement a classification system using hypothesis testing. This task involves:
    - Designing and evaluating the classification system with a confusion matrix.
    - Selecting relevant features and using them for classification.
    - Visualizing the results and decision boundaries.
  
### Task 2: Bayesian Classifier and Sequential Testing
- **Dataset**: 500 samples from two bimodal classes with Gaussian distributions.
- **Objective**: 
  - Visualize the data and the probability density functions.
  - Implement a Bayesian classifier and classify the data.
  - Compare error rates and design a classifier based on minimum cost and error.

### Task 3: Linear and Quadratic Classification
- **Dataset**: 2D shapes from multiple classes.
- **Objective**: 
  - Classify linearly separable shapes using a linear classifier.
  - Extend to non-linearly separable classes using quadratic classifiers.
  - Evaluate classifiers using a confusion matrix.

### Task 4: Clustering
- **Dataset**: 2D data from four linearly separable classes.
- **Objective**: 
  - Implement clustering algorithms (e.g., C-means, Maximum Likelihood).
  - Evaluate sensitivity to initial clustering and number of iterations.
